# SealCore
SealCore is a private project made for a school assignement by @Seeloewen (Louis) and @CDLemmi (Christopher). It is meant for learning purposes only.
Development may be inconsistant and may stop entirely at some point.

# Building
If you want to build the project, clone or download the code and open it in IntelliJ (preferably). To run it, execute **gradlew build**, followed by **gradlew run --args="s"** for the server and **gradlew run --args="c"** for the client. Running **gradlew build** will also yield a fatjar in the build/libs folder that can be used standalone.
